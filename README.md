# Chatroom-101 (WIP)
This is a project I started last summer before I started my software engineering class at CMU. The screenshots below show what I had created 
last summer. I am currently working on this project to add more features to the chatroom, such as login, image upload, sending announcements and improving the UI by using Bootstrap. 

### Tech Stack 
* Node.JS
* Javascript 
* Socket 
* jQuery 
* HTML,CSS

### Current Features 

When the user first enters the chatroom, a pop-up window will ask the user for the username

More than one user can enter the chatroom and chat with other people at the same time
